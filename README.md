## User Experience Personas and Usability Testing
The purpose of this repository is to host various user experience personas and sample usability test reports that can be used for design research.
It contains both UX Personas and Usability Test Reports that were used to emulate real-world business scenarios when developing websites and applications. 
Both personas and usability testing are essential parts of the development process to understand how the final product will be used and what it will provide for the user.

### UX Persona

A persona is a tool that can be used by developers to understand the end-user behaviors based on a prototype of their customer base. Personas will include, at the least:
  
  1. Demographic Information (age, sex, education, family status, etc.)
  2. Motivations (why is the user choosing the product)
  3. Desires (what does the user want from the product)

Consumer groups can often be segmented based on shared characteristics or behaviors, so it is not uncommon to have more than one persona per project.   

### Usability Test Report

The usability test report is the product of conducting a usability test for a website or app. This involves preliminary research of the product to identify any possible pain points that a user may experience during their usability journal, then designing tasks for users to accomplish with the product (i.e., complete an order, sign up for a newsletter, access a specific article, etc.). Usability testing should be done with 3-5 participants (any more than 5 will yield diminishing results) and have a pre-screening and post-test interview. The purpose of the screening and interview is to identify groups that may come in contact with your product and solicit feedback from their experience that can be used to make changes to the product.

The test report details the pre- and post-test design and contains qualitative data collected during the test administration. Participants' thoughts and actions were recorded during the given task. This information is then used to make recommendations to the development team.
